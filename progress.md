- Initialized planning files via planning-with-files skill.

- Identified copy targets: `multi-agent-guide`, `planning-with-files`, `openai-agents-python`.
- Copied local skills into repo: `planning-with-files`, `openai-agents-python`, updated `multi-agent-guide` with `SKILL.md`.
- Updated `README.md` to list new skills.
